                            undergraduate students who have no programming background and are
                            interested to learn how to manage data and conduct business analytics
                            programmatically. It is oriented to enhance their technical skillset.
                            The aim of this course is to provide a broad understanding on how to
                            manage data, the process of preparing data for analysis, basics of
                            analytics, and the means to communicate analytics outcome. This course
                            will equip students with the ability to write customized solutions to
                            inform business decision, integrate statistical libraries for data
                            analysis, and construct visuals or reports for business understanding.

                            hone their coding skills and opportunities to develop coding solutions
                            in a team. We utilize Python language as the medium of learning because
                            it is one of the most in-demand coding language and its user-friendly
                            syntax is well suited for the beginner level. Students will utilise
                            modern development tools to turn information into insights.

                            This course introduces the concepts and methods of statistical
                            inferences: the process of inferring unknowns under uncertainty.
                            Students of this course will also learn programming skills in the R
                            environment for basic statistical analyses. This course consists of
                            three main sections. Section 1 covers elements of probability models.
                            Section 2 covers the basic theories in statistical inferences. Section 3
                            introduces the basic of two powerful and widely used analytic tools:
                            regression and simulation analysis. Each weekly topic will be
                            supplemented with relevant computer applications in the R environment.

                            Business is in the midst of a revolutionary transformation. Emerging
                            technologies that combine AI, machine learning, cutting-edge
                            visualization techniques, and social robots are fast revolutionizing the
                            business workplace globally. Building a motived workforce is a critical
                            responsibility of managers. To do so, managers must know why people
                            behave in organizations the way they do. Research in cognitive sciences,
                            artificial intelligence and neuroscience has generated significant
                            insights that can enrich our knowledge of people. This course is
                            designed to focus on processes and methods that can improve the
                            attitudes and behaviors of organizational members. You will learn to
                            know more about yourself and others. You will also learn how to
                            influence and predict your own behaviours as well as those of others.
                            Within the context of a world of social media, AI, and machine learning,
                            you will learn various organizational behaviour theories and concepts,
                            and then apply them appropriately to real-life situations to make sense
                            of human behaviours and human-robots interactions at work. This course
                            adopts a flipped classroom approach, which will give you ample
                            opportunity to share your knowledge with others and also learn with them
                            collaboratively.

                            Researchers agree that writing is a tool for thinking (Menary, 2007;
                            Klein &amp; Boscolo, 2016; Miller and Jurecic, 2016; Reis, n.d.). As
                            Reis explains, 'The bodily act of writing externalizes our thoughts, and
                            the imposed structure (the written word) provides a vehicle by which
                            those thoughts may be reorganized into new thinking, a new way of seeing
                            the thoughts or a new way of organizing thoughts.' Miller and Jurecic
                            similarly argue that 'writers discover what they think not before they
                            write but in the act of writing' (2016, p. 60). One of the main aims of
                            this course is to allow you to experience writing as a tool for thinking
                            and to practice expressing ideas in formal writing and oral
                            communication. While you will have the opportunity to understand and
                            practice the genre conventions that are specific to your discipline
                            later in your studies, this first common communication course is
                            designed to help you form habits of mind that will serve you across the
                            university and even in the world outside of the university. Taken by all
                            first-year undergraduates, this foundational course will develop your
                            written and oral communication skills, as well as your ability to read
                            and analyze texts. It will help you to understand revision as integral
                            to the process of composition, to convey your interpretations and ideas
                            with confidence and clarity, and to consider audience and purpose when
                            you communicate.

                            This course aims to equip students with the philosophical foundations
                            necessary to understand theories of ethics and subsequently apply those
                            theories to real-life scenarios and issues. It also aims to enable
                            students to critically assess the civic institutions that structure
                            their local and global communities. To these ends, the course will
                            examine the nature of ethics, its understanding across different
                            cultures, and how it is manifested in concepts, social structures, and
                            governance institutions. Topics to be explored include human rights,
                            democracy, freedom of speech, inequality, and sexuality. The rights and
                            duties of citizenship shall be a unifying theme. Students will think
                            through assumptions they hold on all of these matters. They will be
                            provided with the tools to understand various and even contradictory
                            perspectives on these important issues.

                            This course is part of the NTU 2025 Education - Common Foundational
                            &amp; Interdisciplinary Collaborative Curriculum (ICC). It aims to
                            provide multi-disciplinary competence in a cross-disciplinary,
                            collaborative learning environment, with student interaction and
                            collaboration across schools as a key learning foundation. As the title
                            connotes, the main objective of this undergraduate course is to examine
                            what constitutes living a good, healthy and flourishing life. According
                            to research, individuals around the world pursue this 'flourishing life'
                            in different ways, be it through improving one's physical fitness,
                            seeking authentic relationships with others, or making a positive change
                            in the environment. Thus, knowing and understanding how the different
                            components of a 'good life' contribute to one's overall functioning is
                            critical to one's healthy wellbeing. The latter, in turn, affords many
                            benefits such as better health (physical, mental and emotional health)
                            and stronger relationships. By the end of this course, you would have
                            developed an awareness of what constitutes living a healthy and
                            flourishing life, both of which indirectly contribute to a successful
                            undergraduate education.
